// THE SOURCE LADDER — steps resolved PER WINDOW, never per day.
//
// The bug this pins, measured on a real MG export: the gen5 on-chip counter
// took the WHOLE day and published 622 steps against the phone's 18,856,
// because the strap only covered the hours it was syncing. The naive fix —
// "the better sensor wins each span" — has its own measured failure: a band
// coverage span means "a live link existed", not "the pedometer was counting",
// and on 2026-08-08 the band claimed 9.35 h for 216 steps while the phone had
// 11 h for 7,775. Handing the band that span loses ~7,000 steps.
//
// So: rank per span, gait density decides whether a band span outranks the
// phone at all, overlaps are counted ONCE, and the on-chip counter — a
// whole-day cumulative total with no window behind it — is PRIMARY on a gen5
// day: the day's steps are the counter plus only the windowed share that
// fell outside band-recorded time, unless the windowed total is larger still
// (all of it measured). The Sep-22 audit caught the inverse: 2–83 minutes of
// windowed coverage suppressing counters of 6,187–16,348 steps.
