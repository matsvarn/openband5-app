// HOME — decision-oriented. "What matters today?"
//
// Three rings that decide the day — what the night gave back, what the day has
// cost, what the night was made of — three signals worth a glance under them,
// and the small set of things the app can honestly say are worth doing. The
// hard part is not the circles: readiness exists on 71 % of days and needs
// four prior nights before it exists at all, so what a ring does with nothing
// in it is the design. See [RingTrio]. No insight feed and no general
// health-observation card: those are OBSERVATION, and observation lives on
// Health. A home screen that also observes is a dashboard, and a dashboard is
// what this rebuild is replacing.
//
// ONE NAMED EXCEPTION, and it is deliberately not a crack in that rule: the
// illness watch ([_bodyWatch]). It is not a feed and it cannot grow into one —
// exactly one detector may render here, it renders only when its own state is
// amber or red, and it is silent on every ordinary day. The reason it earns
// Home is timing rather than importance: the watch is at its most useful when
// it first goes amber, and amber has no notification, so before this the
// earliest signal the app produces could only be found by opening Health and
// scrolling. A signal that arrives too late to act on is not worth computing.
// If a second observation ever wants this slot, the answer is no — build the
// feed on Health where the others already live.
//
// This file also carries the plumbing every screen in this folder shares —
// navigation, the repo handle, and the three ways a value arrives from the
// data layer. They live here rather than in a fourth file because there are
// only three of them and they are read together.

/// `readiness_band`) so the widget, the Watch and Siri paint it in their own
/// palettes instead of each keeping a private copy of the cut-offs. They did,
/// and a 65 rendered green on the phone, orange on the widget and yellow on
/// the wrist. -1 = not scored.
///
/// THE CUT-OFFS ARE THE SCORE'S OWN QUANTILES, NOT ROUND NUMBERS (issue #250).
/// `readinessComposite` is `100 / (1 + exp(-z̄))` with no scale parameter, and
/// z̄ is a weight-renormalised mean of per-input robust z's — each ~N(0,1)
/// against that person's OWN baseline. So the score is a percentile of self
/// whose CENTRE IS 50 BY CONSTRUCTION: a night exactly at personal median
/// scores 50, and the old 40/60/80 bands filed that median night under "Take it
/// easy". Roughly a quarter of all nights fell under "Rest today" and 1.7 %
/// could ever reach "Good to go" — it needed every input ~1.4 SD above median
/// at once. A warning that fires on the typical night is not a warning.
///
/// z̄'s own SD is NOT 1: averaging the disclosed weights (.40/.30/.20/.10,
/// renormalised over present inputs) gives σ ≈ 0.55-0.60 if the inputs were
/// independent, ~0.70 at the positive correlation HRV/RHR/RR actually have.
/// σ ≈ 0.65 is the middle of that, and the cut-offs below are its quantiles:
///
///   score = 100 / (1 + exp(-0.65 · Φ⁻¹(p)))
///     p=.05 → 26   p=.20 → 37   p=.75 → 61
///
/// which lands 5 % of nights on "Rest today", 15 % on "Take it easy", 55 % on
/// "Steady" and 25 % on "Good to go". The median night is now the neutral band,
/// which is the whole point. Under the old cut-offs the same distribution read
/// 27 / 47 / 25 / 2.
///
/// σ is the one soft number here — it is a property of how correlated a given

/// error branch bolted onto three pretty circles. Each ring has four:

///     count under it. Visibly progress towards a real ring; an arc at zero
///     would read as a bad score, which is the lie this exists to avoid. It is
///     drawn only for a `need_baseline` note, the one absence that IS progress.
///   * MEASURED, UNSCALED — sleep with no computed need behind it. The number
///     is real and the fraction is not known, so the track draws empty and the
///     line under it says there is no target yet. Filling it against the
///     hardcoded 480 would be inventing the user's sleep need.
///   * ABSENT — the track alone, the absence in words where the number goes,
///     and the PIPELINE'S OWN reason on a row under the trio which is also the
///     door into the screen that can say more. Three [StatusCard]s is not a
